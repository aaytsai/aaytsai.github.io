            <p> Hello, my name is Audrey Tsai, and I am a third year studying <span style = "color: #cc8400"> cognitive science and computer science </span> at UC Berkeley. I am currently studying abroad in <span style = "color: #e59400"> Copenhagen, Denmark. </p> 
            <p>  I am passionate about <span style = "color: #cc8400"> people, storytelling, and design </span> and am interested in leveraging technology for social good. I have experience collaborating in teams, particularly in directing videos and working with web development, but I am also an independent worker. Ultimately I want to help design for a <span style = "color: #cc8400"> fairer </span> world.</p> 
            <p> I have working knowledge of <span style = "color: #cc8400"> HTML, CSS, Javascript, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Illustrator, film production, and photography</span>, but I am eager to learn more! </p> 
            <p> Feel free to contact me at <span style = "color: #cc8400"> tsai.audrey@berkeley.edu </span> if you want to connect or even to share your story! </p>
